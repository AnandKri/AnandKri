## Projects

### Music Genre Recognition
- An ongoing project where DNN were trained on GTZAN dataset for music genre prediction. Used T-SNE to visualize high-dimensional data and Euclidean distance and Fast-Correlation Based Filter for feature selection.

### Housing Prices Prediction

- The objective was to predict house prices using regression techniques. Used Spearman rank correlation to find non-linearly correlated features. Fitted Ridge regression model on the selected features.

### Classification of Astronomical Objects
- The project aims at classifying astronomical objects by analyzing their observational data. Applied feature engineering and feature generation. Trained K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees and Neural Networks on the data and compared the performance of all three algorithms.
